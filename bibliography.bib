	abstract = {The effective delayed neutron fraction is an important reactor kinetics parameter. In flowing liquid-fuel reactors, this differs from the delayed neutron fraction because of the emission of delayed neutrons with a lower energy spectrum than prompt and the delayed neutron precursor (DNP) drift due to the fuel movement. In general, neglecting delayed neutron precursor drift leads to an over-estimation of the effective delayed neutron fraction. Nevertheless, the capability to simulate this peculiar phenomenon is not available in most reactor physics tools. In this project, a multi-physics approach to modeling DNP drift is developed using the GeN-Foam toolkit, and it benchmarked against available experimental data from the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE). GeN-Foam couples a neutron diffusion solver with a thermal-hydraulics solver. Additionally, a new function was added for solving adjoint multi-group diffusion eigenvalue problems and calculating effective delayed neutron fraction. For benchmarking, an R-Z model of the MSRE was developed in GeN-Foam. The porous media model was applied, and cross sections were generated using the Monte Carlo code Serpent-2 with ENDF/B-VII.1 nuclear data library. In order to evaluate the impact of DNP drift, two steady-state conditions (stationary and flowing salt at 1200 gpm) were simulated. A reactivity change of -241 pcm was calculated using GeN-Foam for the MSRE between static and flowing fuel, which is in a good agreement with the experimental value of -212 pcm. The total effective delayed neutron fraction change was calculated to be -230 pcm vs. -304 pcm reported for the MSRE and analytical calculated during the experimental campaign. Three transient accidents were also analyzed.},

	abstract = {Current interest in advanced nuclear energy and molten salt reactor (MSR) concepts has enhanced interest in building the tools necessary to analyze these systems. A Python script known as ChemTriton has been developed to simulate equilibrium MSR fuel cycle performance by modeling the changing isotopic composition of an irradiated fuel salt using SCALE for neutron transport and depletion calculations. Improved capabilities in ChemTriton include a generic geometry capable of modeling multi-zone and multi-fluid systems, enhanced time-dependent feed and separations, and a critical concentration search. Although more generally applicable, the capabilities developed to date are illustrated in this paper in three applied problems: (1) simulating the startup of a thorium-based MSR fuel cycle (a likely scenario requires the first of these MSRs to be started without available 233U); (2) determining the effect of the removal of different fission products on MSR operations; and (3) obtaining the equilibrium concentration of a mixed-oxide light-water reactor fuel in a two-stage fuel cycle with a sodium fast reactor. The third problem is chosen to demonstrate versatility in an application to analyze the fuel cycle of a non-MSR system. In the first application, the initial fuel salt compositions fueled with different sources of fissile material are made feasible after (1) removing the associated nonfissile actinides after much of the This manuscript has been authored by UT-Battelle, LLC under Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the U.S. Department of Energy.

	abstract = {Interest in circulating fuel reactors (CFRs), particularly molten salt reactors (MSRs) of the fluid fuel type, has been growing in the last two decades. Starting with a resurgence of interest in Europe, there have been a growing number of methods proposed and codes developed to model the kinetics of CFRs, which is a capability essential to the design and evaluation of such reactors. This work first reviews the physical phenomena unique to CFRs in light of current research and how CFR kinetics are impacted by these considerations. In general, it is found that the movement of delayed neutron precursors (DNPs) through the primary loop has significant impacts on transients at low reactor powers or those with significant spatial components such as a change in the primary loop mass flow rate. Effects on the neutron flux are exceedingly minimal and entirely negligible. An extensive review of published models and methods for simulating CFR kinetics is presented, along with transient simulations in fast and thermal neutron flux systems using representative codes from each of the main modeling categories. Comparisons among methods are presented as are recommendations for their use or nonuse in various transient and work-flow scenarios. In general, it is recommended that time-resolved, multigroup neutron diffusion approaches be used to establish ranges of applicability for point reactor kinetics (PRK)–based approaches that themselves may not be applicable for all modeling situations. In such cases, it is suggested that quasi-static approaches be used where PRK-based approaches cannot be used. Finally, a review of common assumptions used in these models is presented, along with an evaluation of their impact on model performance. It is found that neglecting turbulent diffusion in open core–type CFRs is a poor assumption that leads to an underestimation of the reduction of the delayed neutron fraction. Additionally, it is seen that exclusion of secondary heat transfer loops in models leads to underestimation of transient peaks and troughs.},

To further develop these MSR concepts, researchers need simulation tools for analyzing liquid-fueled MSR depletion and fuel processing. However, most contemporary nuclear reactor physics software is unable to perform high-ﬁdelity full-core depletion calculations for a reactor design with online reprocessing. This paper introduces a Python package, SaltProc, which couples with the Monte Carlo code, SERPENT2 to simulate MSR online reprocessing by modeling the changing isotopic composition of MSR fuel salt. This work demonstrates SaltProc capabilities for a fullcore, high-ﬁdelity model of the commercial Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR) concept and veriﬁes these results to results in the literature from independent, lower-ﬁdelity analyses.},

	abstract = {In the last few years, use of thorium in fast reactors has been gaining increasing attention due to its favorable features in terms of waste minimization and resource availability. In particular, use of thorium in a closed cycle leads to a limited build-up of transuranic isotopes, and to a lower radio-toxicity generation. Unfortunately, U233 breeding is always accompanied by the production of undesirable U232, which represents a serious radiological hazard to workers during fuel reprocessing and, in particular, fabrication. A possible way to partially overcome such difficulty would be to avoid fuel pin fabrication through the development of liquid-fuelled reactors, among which the most promising ones are the Molten Salt Reactors. The present paper investigates the fuel cycle performances of the reference GEN-IV Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) in terms of isotope evolution, radio-toxicity generation and safety parameters, considering different fuel cycle strategies. Main results are also compared with those obtained for the GEN-IV ELSY Lead Fast Reactor. Calculations are performed by means of the EQL3D procedure developed at the Paul Scherrer Institut (Switzerland) for the analysis of equilibrium fuel cycles in fast reactors. In order to take into account the peculiarities of the MSFR design, a modified version of the procedure is proposed and adopted to model on-line reprocessing and the presence of blankets.},

[1] A comprehensive set of fuel cycle options are put into evaluation groups based on physics and fuel cycle characteristics. Representative options for each group are then evaluated to provide the quantitative information needed to support the valuation of criteria and metrics used for the study. Included in this set of representative options are Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs), the analysis of which requires several capabilities that are not adequately supported by the current version of SCALE or other neutronics depletion software packages (e.g., continuous online feed and removal of materials). A new analysis approach was developed for MSR analysis using SCALE by taking user-specified MSR parameters and performing a series of SCALE/TRITON calculations to determine the resulting equilibrium operating conditions. This paper provides a detailed description of the new analysis approach, including the modeling equations and radiation transport models used. Results for an MSR fuel cycle option of interest are also provided to demonstrate the application to a relevant problem. The current implementation is through a utility code that uses the two-dimensional (2D) TRITON depletion sequence in SCALE 6.1 but could be readily adapted to three-dimensional (3D) TRITON depletion sequences or other versions of SCALE.

	abstract = {In the paper, the development of a multiphysics model for the transient analysis of non-moderated Molten Salt Reactors is discussed. Particular attention is devoted to the description of the adopted time integration and physics coupling strategies. The proposed model features the adoption of an implicit Runge–Kutta scheme and the coupling among neutron diffusion, Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes equations for mass and momentum conservation, and energy and delayed neutron precursor balance equations, in order to accurately catch thermal feedbacks on neutronics. The solver is aimed at performing fast-running simulations of the full-core three-dimensional Molten Salt Fast Reactor geometry. The neutronics modelling is assessed against Monte Carlo simulations and the results of a simpliﬁed case study are compared to those from multiphysics tools previously developed. As an example of the capability of the model, an unprotected MSFR single pump failure accidental scenario is simulated and discussed. The main purpose of the present model is to serve as fast-running computational tool in the phase of design optimization of fuel loop components. More in general, it is of valuable help in the study of reactor physics of circulating-fuel systems.},

	abstract = {Adopting liquid fuel and on-line reprocessing scenario are the unique features of molten salt reactor (MSR). Considering lattice code for thermal reactor is not suitable for MSR calculation, batch-wise fuel salt reprocessing scheme and “two-step” deterministic calculations cause some approximations in simulation of MSR on-line continuous fuel reprocessing, this study focuses on the development of a direct calculation method for MSR fuel cycle simulation based on an open source Monte Carlo code OpenMC. A ﬁctitious decay constant and an external source term were introduced into traditional burnup equation for accurate simulation of on-line fuel reprocessing. Finally, a MSR fuel cycle simulation code OpenMCB-MSR was developed by coupling OpenMC and burnup code with Python script. Two pressurized water reactor (PWR) pin cell benchmarks without considering fuel online reprocessing, and one actual MSFR fuel cycle benchmark considering fuel on-line reprocessing were used for veriﬁcation of OpenMCB-MSR. By comparison with reference results, the maximum diﬀerences of kinf calculated by OpenMCB-MSR are no more than 400 pcm both for two PWR pin cell benchmarks. Moreover, apart from isotopes with small absolute nuclide number density, all the other isotopes' nuclide number densities show a diﬀerence of less than 10\%. For MSFR benchmark, the reactivity coeﬃcients, isotope mass evolutions during fuel cycle process, mass evolution of ﬁssion products in core and breeding ratio calculated by OpenMCB-MSR show a good agreement with reference results. At equilibrium state, apart from isotopes with very small absolute mass, the diﬀerences of other isotopes' mass are no more than 5.0\% in comparison with reference results. Benchmark veriﬁcation results indicate that the method of MSR fuel cycle simulation based on OpenMC code is correct, and OpenMCB-MSR has capability of MSR fuel cycle analysis.},

FAMOS can also calculate the effective delayed neutron fraction accounting for the motion of fuel salt, the neutron generation time and the reactivity feedback coefﬁcients. In order to verify the FAMOS code, the molten salt fast reactor (MSFR) proposed in the EVOL (Evaluation and Viability of Liquid Fuel Fast Reactor System) project was analyzed using FAMOS and the calculation results were compared with the reported results. The numerical results indicate that FAMOS is capable of simulating the fuel cycle process of MSRs with good accuracy. FAMOS was applied to the fuel cycle analysis of the molten salt breeder reactor (MSBR) as well. The effects of the temperature distribution and the drift of delayed neutron precursors on the neutronics characteristics and fuel cycle performances of MSBR were evaluated using three different calculation models. The drift of delayed neutron precursors and the temperature distribution shift the axial power distribution upward and downward, respectively, and the latter effect is stronger than the former one. However, the impacts of the temperature distribution and the drift of delayed neutron precursors on the depletion and buildup behaviors of actinides and ﬁssion products in MSRs are negligible. It is also possible to achieve a 233U conversion ratio larger than 1.0 without protactinium removal and thus to operate the MSBR by only feeding 232Th, except for the initial start-up stage.},

The fuel of such reactors being liquid, it can be easily reprocessed to overcome neutronic limits. In the late sixties, the MSBR project showed that breeding is possible with thorium in a thermal spectrum, provided that an efficient pyrochemical reprocessing is added. With tools developed around the Monte Carlo MCNP code, we first re-evaluate the performance of a MSBR-1ike refeience system with 232Th/233Ufuel. We find an important reduction of inventories and induced radiotoxicities at equilibrium compared to other fuel cycles, with a doubling time of about thirty years. We then study how to start this interesting reference system with the plutonium from PWR spent fuel. Such a transition appears slow and difficult, since it is very sensitive to the fissile quality of the plutonium used. Deployment scenarios of 232Th/233U MSBR-like systems from the existing French PWRs demonstrate the advantage of an upstream 233Uproduction in other reactors, allowing a direct start of the MSBR-like systems with 233U. This finally leads us to explore alternatives to some MSBR features, for energy production with {\textasciitilde}3UTh/233U fuel from the start. We thus test different options, especially in terms of core neutronics optimization and reprocessing unit adaptation.},

MOSART is one of conceptual designs in the molten salt reactor (MSR) category of the Generation-IV systems. This type of reactors is distinguished by the use of liquid fuel circulating in and out of the core, which offers many unique advantages but complicates the modeling and simulation of core behavior using conventional reactor physics codes. The TRITON control module in SCALE6 can perform reliable depletion and decay analysis for many reactor physics applications due to its problem-dependent cross-section processing and rigorous treatment of neutron transport. In order to accommodate a simulation of on-line refueling and reprocessing scenarios, several in-house programs together with a run script were developed to integrate a series of stepwise TRITON calculations; the result greatly facilitates the neutronics analyses of long-term MSR operation. Using this method, a detailed reexamination of the MOSART operation in 30 years was performed to investigate the neutronic characteristics of the core design, the change of fuel salt composition from start-up to equilibrium, the effects of various salt reprocessing scenarios, the performance of actinide transmutation, and the radiotoxicity reduction.},

	abstract = {A neutronic parametric study is performed for graphite-moderated molten-salt (MS) critical or source-driven sub-critical transmuting reactors. The NaF-ZrF 4 MS reactor is fuelled with transuranium isotopes from LWR spent fuel and operates in a once-through mode. The MS with actinides is continuously fed and continuously extracted at a very slow rate. All the fission products are removed from the core as soon as formed. The primary question addressed is whether or not it is possible to design such a reactor to have an acceptable k eff when at equilibrium composition, while the Ac concentration is below their solubility limit, and what is the corresponding transmutation fraction. The primary design variables are the MS channel diameter and the graphite-to-MS volume ratio (C/MS). For an average power density of 390 W/cm 3 of MS, MS feed rate of 1 millilitre/day/MW th and actinide concentration of 12.87 mol\% it was found that both k eff and the fractional transmutation peak while the equilibrium concentration is at a minimum when C/MS is close to 1.0. The equilibrium actinide concentration is below the solubility limit for C/MS between 1 and 7 for 7cm and 3.5 cm channel diameter and between 1 and 15 for a 1 cm channel diameter. The peak k eff is close to 1.0 and the fractional transmutation exceeds 90\% in one pass through the core. The Pu coming out from the C/MS=12 core has a very low fissile content of only 17\%. The optimal core has an epithermal spectrum and small channel diameter. The graphite lifetime in the core is 0.6 or 1.3 years for C/MS of 1 or 3, respectively. Reduction of the power density to 39 W/cm 3 can increase the graphite lifetime by an order of magnitude. This reduction of the power density reduces the attainable k eff by {\textasciitilde}5\% and increases the equilibrium actinide concentration by {\textasciitilde}0.4 mol\%. An illustrative core design for a 10 GW th MS transmuter is given.},

	abstract = {To support molten salt reactor commercialization, tools for calculating molten salt reactor fuel composition and reactivity changes during operation are being developed. Leveraging the capabilities of the SCALE code system, a one-dimensional delayed neutron precursor drift model has been implemented in the TRITON/NEWT transport module. With the fuel loop length, core height, fluid velocity, and core axial power shape, this model calculates the concentration of each delayed neutron precursor group within the onedimensional loop. The model uses correction factors generated from these axially dependent concentrations to calculate the flow-adjusted parameters for the fission spectrum (χf) and the total number of neutrons per fission (ν̄f) for the transport solver and cross section collapse. The SCALE implementation performs well in comparisons to analytic solutions of the one-dimensional model. This capability is demonstrated in an application to a TRITON/NEWT model of a unit cell of the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor. Results show nearly 40\% of the total delayed neutrons are emitted outside of the core. A large fraction of the delayed neutrons drift to downstream low-power (in-core) regions, largely augmenting the delayed neutron source in these regions. The small axial region adjacent to the core outlet experiences a delayed neutron source that is over six times what is produced locally from fissions (as would be assumed for a no-drift transport calculation). For this application, differences between the no-drift solution and using the flow-adjusted parameters is up to 1\%–2\% in keff and some collapsed two-group constants.},

As the aim of this study is to provide an insight to this single change of the core and to apply it to increase the lifespan of the graphite, the variations were performed only on the radial direction of the graphite–salt lattice in a cylindrical core. The obtained results were compared with a reference core in which the salt is distributed uniformly. It is possible to increase the breeding gain or the graphite lifespan by separating the core into two radial zones with different amount of graphite. On the other hand, it is only possible to increase one by the cost of decreasing the other one due to the change in the power distribution induced by the change in the core geometry.},

	abstract = {Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) has the characteristics of drift effect of delayed neutron precursors (DNP), direct heating of coolant and moderator cooled by fuel salt under most conditions, which bring signiﬁcant differences from traditional reactors in dynamics calculation. To deal with the unique dynamics characteristics of MSR, a speciﬁc three-dimensional spatial dynamics code – TMSR3D has been developed, in which the fourth order standard nodal expansion method and the exponential transformation method are implemented to solve the neutron diffusion equations and the neutron kinetics equations respectively, the parallel multi-channel thermal hydraulics (TH) model is adopted to take into account the feedbacks of local temperature to group constants, and a convection term is introduced to the traditional balance equations for DNP to consider the inﬂuence of fuel salt ﬂow. Besides, the least square ﬁtting method is employed to parameterize the few-group homogenized parameters generated by the lattice code DRAGON5. The 3D-LRA core benchmark is ﬁrst used to verify TMSR3D for solid-fueled reactor problem. Afterwards, the experimental data of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) collected in the European project MOST are simulated, which includes the transients perturbed by protected fuel pump start-up and coast-down at zero power, and the natural circulation experiment. The numerical results indicate that the developed code is capable of providing a reasonable description for the neutronicsTH coupling phenomena of graphite-moderated channel-type MSRs.},

The Molten Salt Fast Reactor is adopted as test case for the comparison of the analytical, deterministic and Monte Carlo methods presented. The Monte Carlo code SERPENT-2 has been extended to allow for delayed neutron precursors drift, according to the fuel velocity ﬁeld. The forward and adjoint eigenvalue multi-group diffusion problems are implemented and solved adopting the multi-physics toolkit OpenFOAM, by taking into account the convective and turbulent diffusive terms in the precursors balance. These two approaches show good agreement in the whole range of the MSFR operating conditions. An analytical formula for the circulating-to-static conditions beff correction factor is also derived under simple hypotheses, which explicitly takes into account the spatial dependence of the neutron importance. Its accuracy is assessed against Monte Carlo and deterministic results. The effects of in-core recirculation vortex and turbulent diffusion are ﬁnally analysed and discussed.},

	abstract = {Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) has the characteristics of on-line reprocessing and continuously refueling, which bring significant differences from traditional reactors in burnup calculations. To handle its specific burnup characteristics, a Molten Salt Reactor specific depletion code - MODEC has been newly developed. MODEC implements two depletion algorithms to solve the basic burnup equations: the transmutation trajectory analysis (TTA) and the Chebyshev rational approximation method (CRAM). To simulate the on-line reprocessing, the fictive decay constant method is applied. And three different methods are implemented in MODEC to solve the nonhomogeneous burnup equations in the continuously refueling problems. Moreover, it can trace in real time the evolution of the in-stockpile nuclides which is extracted by on-line reprocessing. MODEC has three calculating modes for decay, constant flux and constant power calculations. By comparing with ORIGEN-S, the validity of performance of MODEC in conventional burnup calculations, burnup calculations with on-line reprocessing and burnup calculations with continuously refueling is proved. And a comparison of the three methods of solving nonhomogeneous burnup equations is presented and discussed. Additionally, a detailed analysis of error sources in ORIGEN-S is applied and an unpublished error source is found. Finally, a specific Monte Carlo burnup procedure for actual MSR burnup calculations is developed by coupling KENO-VI with MODEC, and the burnup benchmark of Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) is calculated to validate the specific Monte Carlo burnup procedure.},

	abstract = {There is currently a renewed interest in small modular reactor (SMR) and molten salt reactor (MSR) concepts, since the former is recognized as the most accessible form of nuclear energy with a lower cost compared to conventional reactors while the latter is considered as one of the reference reactors of the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) suited for thorium fuel cycle. The TRUs from the spent fuel of LWRs containing more than 50\% of ﬁssile fuels may be used to start up a MSR due to its outstanding features of no fuel assembly and online/ batch reprocessing. This study aims to analyze the characteristics of a small modular thorium-based molten salt reactor (sm-TMSR) using TRUs and Th as ﬁssile and fertile fuels towards thorium fuel cycle with a batch reprocessing mode. The neutronic properties using TRUs as an igniting fuel in the core conﬁgurations with the fuel salt fraction (SF) of 18.4\%/27.4\% and the reprocessing periods (RPs) of 5/10 years are ﬁrst analyzed and compared. To obtain a high production of U233, the conﬁguration with SF = 27.4\% and RP = 5 years is recommended. The recovered uranium production and the purity of U233 can achieve \$69 kg/y and over 75\%, respectively. Furthermore, the recovered uranium demand with thorium fuel cycle in the 27.4\% core and other thermal sm-TMSRs are evaluated. In the 27.4\% core, the recovered uranium demand during 40-year operation is \$38 kg/y. For the new smTMSRs with the SF ranging from 2\% to 18.4\%, the recovered uranium demand varies from 148 to 48 kg/y. Finally, transition scenarios to thorium fuel cycle are proposed. The transition time is about 22 years in the 27.4\% core while it is about 28 years in the SF = 18.4\% core. The simulated results demonstrate that it is feasible to achieve the transition from TRUs to thorium fuel cycle in sm-TMSRs if a batch reprocessing mode can be adopted.},

	abstract = {The molten chloride salt fast reactor (MCFR) with Th-U fuel cycle is attracting more and more attention because of its excellent performance, such as high solubility of actinides, superior breeding capacity, low waste production, and high inherent safety. First of all, the breeding capability of an MCFR at equilibrium state was optimized by an in-house automated optimization program. Based on an optimized MCFR, an investigation of Th-U cycle performance was performed. Due to the lack of available 233U in nature, transuranium (TRU), low-enriched uranium (LEU), and Pu were employed as the startup fissile materials, and two different transition scenarios, a breeding and burning (B\&B) scenario and a pre-breeding and burning (PBB) scenario were studied. The results show that the breeding performance in an MCFR is attractive and that the Th-U fuel transition can be achieved smoothly by using LEU, Pu, or TRU as startup fissile materials. In the B\&B scenario, the average net 233U production rate in the LEU-started, TRU-started, and Pu-started modes during 200-year operation is 374, 321, and 323 kg/a, respectively, at the reprocessing rate of 200 L/day. While in the PB\&B scenario the average annual 233U production is about 570 kg for all startup cases at a reprocessing rate of 40 L/day, and the corresponding doubling time is about 9.6 years. Besides, the values of the fuel Doppler coefficient and density coefficient are negative, and the total temperature coefficient of reactivity in all scenarios is below −8 pcm/K. In addition, the value of radiotoxicity of the Th-U cycle in an MCFR is lower than that in other molten salt reactors like the molten-salt breeder reactor and the molten fluoride salt reactor due to the lower buildup of fission products and TRU under its hard spectrum.},

Simulations illustrate stable behavior of the reactor dynamics and temperature feedback effects to reactivity excursions. Stable and smooth changes at various nodal temperatures are also observed. Control strategies for molten-salt reactor operation are discussed, followed by an illustration of the open-loop load-following capability of the molten-salt breeder reactor system. It is observed that the molten-salt breeder reactor system exhibits “self-regulating” behavior, minimizing the need for external controller action for load-following maneuvers.},

The characteristics of TMSRs based on a fast neutron spectrum are detailed in this paper, focusing on their excellent level of deterministic safety. We aimed at designing a critical TMSR able to burn the Plutonium and the Minor Actinides produced in the currently operating reactors, and consequently to convert this Plutonium into 233U. This leads to closing the current fuel cycle thanks to TMSRs started with transuranic elements on a Thorium base, i.e. started in the Th/Pu fuel cycle.
